Hello everyone :)

I'd like to introduce to You how to program ATmega328p microprocessor. 
I will work with Datasheet using microprocessor registers.
All examples in this repository will be written using embedded C language.

I'll focus on how-to-set ATmega328p features like

- IO configuration
- Timers
- ADC
- USART
- Analog Comparator
and so on...
